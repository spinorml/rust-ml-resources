# Machine Learning with Rust

Rust is a fantastic platform to build production machine learning infrastructure. Here are some of the reasons why we have chosen to build on Rust.

1. High performance
2. Robust Security model
3. Excellent tooling
4. Inter-operability with C/C++
5. Ability to run in resource-constrained environments
